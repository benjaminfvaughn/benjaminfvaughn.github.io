My favorite life hack from 2023 was learning about the online resources available with my library card. Through my library, I'm able to access O'Reilly, New York Times, auto repair manuals, LinkedIn Learning, WSJ, Washington Post, and plenty more. Everyone should have a library card and check which online resources are available. You pay for these resources through your taxes. Cancel a streaming service and spend that time you were wasting to learn someting new.
