Plain text should be simple. But for all of plain-text's simplicity on one machine, once you want to sync these plain text files to your iOS device, it gets harder. As far as I know, there is only one app on iOS that allows you to work with plain-text files in the iOS file system and push and pull from a git server. That app is [Working Copy](https://workingcopy.app/). While there is nothing to complain about Working Copy--it's probably one of the most powerful apps on the platform--it bothers me there isn't an alternative or competitor. If the sole author of Working Copy decides to retire, plain-text on the platform is ceases to work. All other options that I'm aware of require you to have an account on someone else's server. I wish Working Copy had competition.
