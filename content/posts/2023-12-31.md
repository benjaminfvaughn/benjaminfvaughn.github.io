Growing up with the internet, I've had several blogging experiences. I remember having Blogspot, Tumblr, and Wordpress blogs. None of these contain anything worth reading today. But even though I wrote drivel, I'm glad I wrote. These gave me a sense that I had a "place" on the internet--that I had made a mark on the universe--that I *contributed* to the *project* of the internet. Lately, I've been feeling the urge to contribute again. And a desire that I could look backwards from today and see a continuous body of work that was (occasionally) improving. There's no more cliche time than the new year to start something you wish you had already started.
